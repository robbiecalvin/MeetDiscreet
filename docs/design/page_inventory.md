# MeetDiscreet — Page Inventory

## 1. Purpose

Track MeetDiscreet’s planned pages, interface surfaces, dependencies,
and production status.

This inventory is not a requirement to create one HTML file per row.

Related functions may use tabs, dialogs, drawers, or shared detail pages
when that improves usability.

Final source paths and URLs are assigned during implementation.

Do not treat the proposed names below as existing files.

## 2. Related Documents

- ../../AGENTS.md
- ../product/product_spec.md
- ../product/access_matrix.md
- ../next_steps.md
- ../decisions.md
- ./design_system.md
- ./design_memory.md
- ./page_briefs/

The roadmap owns phase progress.
This document owns page and interface-surface coverage.

Page briefs own page-specific design decisions.

## 3. Status Convention

Initial status for all surfaces:

- Implementation: Not started or not verified.
- Verification: Not checked.
- Visual review: Not requested.
- Integration: Not connected.
- Deployment: Not verified.

Update individual records as actual work occurs.

Do not infer approval from implementation or silence.

For compact tracking, use these labels:

- Planned.
- Designing.
- Building.
- Awaiting review.
- Changes requested.
- Accepted for current scope.

Keep verification, integration, and deployment information separate
when those distinctions matter.

## Current Implemented Surfaces

PUB-01 discovery and SH-01 entrance gate are implemented as frontend prototypes
in index.html and src/. PUB-02/PUB-03 are in-page demo ad categories. Profile/ad
details and policy notices are limited dialogs, not completed standalone pages.
See [discovery brief](./page_briefs/discovery.md). Visual review pending; no real
integrations or production deployment. PUB-06 now has a public frontend profile at `/?profile=<id>`, documented in
[the profile brief](./page_briefs/companion-profile.md); member/subscriber sections
are labels only. PUB-05 now has an Offering detail route at `/?ad=<id>`; see
[Offering brief](./page_briefs/offering-ad.md). PUB-08 now has How it works/reference plans at `/?page=how-it-works`; see
[How it works brief](./page_briefs/how-it-works.md). USR-05/COM-08 now have a shared demo draft editor at `/?page=create-listing`; see
[listing editor brief](./page_briefs/listing-editor.md). No saving or publication is connected. PUB-09 now has the working guidelines reader at `/?page=guidelines`, accessible
without age confirmation; see [guidelines brief](./page_briefs/guidelines.md). PUB-10 now has searchable Help at `/?page=help`; see
[Help brief](./page_briefs/help.md). Operational contact/report channels remain unconnected. AUTH-01/AUTH-02/AUTH-04 now have account-screen previews at `/?page=register`,
`/?page=sign-in`, and `/?page=recover-account`; see [account brief](./page_briefs/account-entry.md). Optional Supabase development authentication is implemented; hosted lifecycle
checks remain incomplete. The account overview at `/?page=account` links private
draft tools. COM-02 now has a companion profile draft editor at `/?page=edit-profile`; see
[profile editor brief](./page_briefs/profile-editor.md). Connected mode supports
private saving, with no public publishing. Partial COM-05 now has the experience catalogue draft at `/?page=experiences`;
see [experience brief](./page_briefs/experiences.md). Public general rates and live billing remain unimplemented. Other inventory surfaces remain planned.

## 4. Inventory Fields

Each implemented page or substantial interface surface should have:

- Stable identifier.
- Working name.
- Purpose.
- Audience.
- Actual URL or parent surface.
- Source file or module.
- Page brief.
- Dependencies.
- Implementation status.
- Review status.
- Verification notes.
- Integration and deployment status.

Do not fill unknown paths with invented values.

## 5. Shared Site Surfaces

| ID | Surface | Purpose | Main dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| SH-01 | Entrance age gate | Confirm entrance eligibility and preserve destination | Gate policy and retention decision |
| SH-02 | Public navigation | Navigate public discovery and account entry | Initial design direction |

Shared surfaces do not necessarily need standalone URLs.

Do not implement separate incompatible age gates or navigation
on individual pages.

Do not build a maintenance system merely to satisfy this inventory.

Pricing and how-it-works content may be combined or separated
during design.

## 7. Authentication and Onboarding

| ID | Page or surface | Purpose | Main dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUTH-01 | Registration | Create an account | Authentication and eligibility |

Settings may consolidate several surfaces.

Messages, booking detail, and billing should reuse shared components
where companion and user workflows overlap.

## 9. Companion Workspace

| ID | Page or surface | Purpose | Main dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| COM-01 | Dashboard | Summarize companion activity | Relevant connected data |
| COM-02 | Profile editor | Manage companion introduction and fields | Ownership and visibility |

| COM-13 | Earnings/payouts | Distinguish allocations and actual payouts | Financial reconciliation |
| COM-14 | Reviews | Read and respond where permitted | Review policy |
| COM-15 | Messages and calls | Use authorized communication | Shared communication components |

Do not duplicate USR and COM pages unnecessarily.

A shared booking-detail implementation may expose different authorized
actions according to participant role.

The same principle applies to messaging and billing components.

## 10. Administration

| ID | Page or surface | Purpose | Main dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADM-01 | Operations dashboard | Show actionable operational information | Defined staff capabilities |
| ADM-02 | Account management | Review accounts and apply permitted actions | Role and restriction rules |
| ADM-03 | Content review | Review profiles, listings, and media | Moderation process |

| ADM-08 | Configuration | Manage explicitly editable settings | Configuration permissions |
| ADM-09 | Audit history | Inspect consequential operational actions | Implemented audit records |
| ADM-10 | Support cases | Handle account and service concerns | Support process |

Administrative pages require explicit backend capabilities.

Do not assume every moderator can access every administrative surface.

Do not create unrestricted financial adjustment controls.

## 11. Transaction and System States

These may appear as pages, dialogs, or states within existing surfaces.

| ID | State | Required behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| SYS-01 | Checkout return | Fetch actual payment status; do not trust redirect alone |
| SYS-02 | Payment pending | Explain pending verification and recovery |
| SYS-03 | Payment failed/cancelled | Offer appropriate next actions |
| SYS-04 | Booking reservation expired | Explain current agreement/payment situation |
| SYS-05 | Subscription expired | Show permitted access and renewal options |
| SYS-06 | Publishing expired | Apply confirmed visibility and management rules |
| SYS-07 | Account restricted | Explain permitted information and support route |
| SYS-08 | Empty results | Help users adjust discovery or filters |
| SYS-09 | Network failure | Preserve input where practical and support retry |
| SYS-10 | Media unavailable | Avoid exposing private storage details |
| SYS-11 | Call failure | Explain permissions or connection outcome |
| SYS-12 | Submission success | Show only verified completion of the relevant action |

Do not show a success state for an unverified transaction.

## 12. Page Design Process

Before a new page enters implementation:

1. Read its functional requirements.
2. Read existing shared visual decisions.
3. Identify unresolved page-specific choices.
4. Ask Robbie a focused questionnaire.
5. Create or update its page brief.
6. Build a reviewable version.
7. Inspect and revise it.

Do not require all pages to be designed upfront.

Do not repeat settled global questions.

Clear later edit requests do not require a new full questionnaire.

## 13. Suggested Initial Production Order

After documentation and foundational decisions:

1. Shared design foundation.
2. Entrance age gate and public navigation.
3. Homepage/discovery.
4. Offering and Looking For results.
5. Listing detail.
6. Companion profile.
7. Authentication and onboarding.
8. User and companion profile editors.
9. Listing editors and management.
10. Relevant subscription and publishing surfaces.
11. Booking surfaces.
12. Communication surfaces.
13. Operational tools and remaining account pages.

Adjust ordering for actual dependencies.

Implement basic reporting, blocking, and required moderation before
exposing affected functionality to real users.

The order does not authorize postponing essential operational controls.

## 14. Design Questions by Page Type

### Discovery

Ask about:

- Initial content emphasis.
- Search/filter placement.
- Card versus row treatment.
- Density.
- Sponsored placement.
- Mobile filtering.

### Profile

Ask about:

- Image prominence.
- Gallery.
- Introduction hierarchy.
- Rate and action placement.
- Tabs or sections.
- Locked-content presentation.
- Mobile actions.

### Editor

Ask about:

- Single-page or stepped form.
- Preview placement.
- Upgrade sidebar.
- Price summary.
- Save/publish actions.
- Mobile consolidation.

### Dashboard

Ask about:

- Highest-priority information.
- Activity layout.
- Navigation.
- Action shortcuts.
- Density.
- Mobile ordering.

### Booking

Ask about:

- Form progression.
- Schedule selection.
- Price breakdown.
- Agreement summary.
- Revisions.
- Mobile checkout behaviour.

Use these as prompts, not a mandatory repeated script.

## 15. Page Brief Naming

Use descriptive kebab-case filenames.

Examples:

- homepage.md
- discovery-results.md
- companion-profile.md
- looking-for-editor.md
- offering-editor.md
- booking-request.md
- booking-detail.md

These are naming examples, not existing files.

A shared brief may cover closely related surfaces when their differences
are documented clearly.

Do not create empty briefs for every future page.

## 16. Active Page Record

Create an entry when work begins on a page.

Suggested fields:

- Inventory ID:
- Working title:
- Actual URL or parent surface:
- Source files:
- Page brief:
- Audience and permissions:
- Dependencies:
- Implementation status:
- Visual review status:
- Verification:
- Integration status:
- Deployment status:
- Outstanding feedback:
- Next action:

No active application page has been verified by this initial draft.

## 17. Consolidation and Changes

If pages are merged, split, renamed, or removed:

- Update this inventory.
- Update relevant briefs.
- Update navigation and links.
- Check direct navigation.
- Record material scope decisions.
- Preserve deferred requirements in the roadmap.

Do not silently drop functionality during consolidation.

Do not retain broken links to pages that no longer exist.

## 18. Policy and Copy Placement

Keep detailed boundaries on PUB-09.

Use concise, contextual pricing and acceptance information on
transactional surfaces.

Do not add repeated disclaimer cards to every page.

Age-gate, policy, and support accessibility must follow the product rules.

## 19. Final Rule

Keep the inventory aligned with the actual application.

Plan broadly, design progressively, and record real implementation
and review status without inventing completion.
The private development listing library is available at `/?page=my-listings`,
linked from Account. It manages saved drafts rather than public or published ads;
see [listing editor brief](./page_briefs/listing-editor.md).

Partial COM-06 has an in-memory weekly availability editor at `/?page=availability`.
See [availability brief](./page_briefs/availability.md). It does not reserve times
or expose real booking availability.
