# MeetDiscreet — Access Matrix

## 1. Purpose

Define visibility, ownership, roles, and paid entitlements for MeetDiscreet.

This document describes intended permissions.
It does not establish that authorization is implemented.

Read alongside:

- ../../AGENTS.md
- ./product_spec.md
- ./pricing_and_payments.md
- ./booking_lifecycle.md
- ../architecture/application_architecture.md
- ../security/application_security.md
- ../decisions.md

If a permission remains unresolved, do not silently grant access.

Continue independent implementation where possible.
Resolve the rule before releasing the dependent feature.

## 2. Permission Model

Evaluate access using the relevant combination of:

- Identity.
- Account status.
- Role.
- Resource ownership.
- Resource visibility.
- Companion-specific subscription.
- Premium user membership.
- Companion publishing status.
- Conversation membership.
- Booking participation.
- Block relationships.
- Moderation assignments.

Roles and paid entitlements are separate.

A user may hold several entitlements without receiving additional
administrative privileges.

A server-controlled role foundation is implemented in the prepared account-role
migration. It initializes only basic User membership, allows own-role reads, and
denies client role assignment. This is separate from identity/eligibility
verification and paid/public access. Hosted migration application remains pending.

Approved Providers retain authoritative User membership under the same login
(DEC-023). Onboarding preference remains untrusted user metadata, not an assigned
role; it grants no publishing, subscriber, verification or administrative permission.

## 3. Matrix Legend

- Allowed: permitted subject to applicable account and resource rules.
- Own: limited to resources owned by the account.
- Participating: limited to the relevant booking, conversation, or transaction.
- Assigned: limited to explicitly authorized operational duties.
- Pending: requires a confirmed product decision.
- Denied: not permitted through this role or entitlement.

“All subscribers” does not mean every subscriber to the platform.

A companion-specific entitlement applies only to the relevant companion.

## 4. General Enforcement Rules

- Public resources may allow anonymous access.
- Protected resources require trusted authorization.
- Clients cannot assign their own roles or paid status.
- Ownership must be checked on every relevant operation.
- Resource identifiers do not constitute authorization.
- UI visibility does not enforce backend access.
- APIs must return only permitted fields.
- Realtime channels and attachments require their own access checks.
- Administrative access must be explicitly assigned.

A suspended or restricted account may lose otherwise available actions
according to the defined restriction.

Exact restriction effects must be specified before release.

## 7. Subscriber Isolation

An active subscription to Companion A must not unlock:

- Companion B’s restricted profile fields.
- Companion B’s protected media.
- Messaging with Companion B.
- Calls with Companion B.
- Booking requests to Companion B.

Premium user membership does not alter this rule.

If a profile links to another companion, the link does not transfer access.

Whether one subscription unlocks both presentations of the same companion
remains pending confirmation.

Two-companion booking subscription requirements also remain pending.

Retention of booking-management access after subscription expiry

Do not remove access to receipts, dispute routes, or necessary
transaction records merely because a subscription expires.

## 14. Messages and Attachments

| Action | Authorized participant | Unrelated account | Operational staff |
|---|---|---|---|

| Update own read receipt | Participating | Denied | Denied |

Subscription alone does not grant access to unrelated conversations.

scope, and audit trail.

Historical message access after expiry remains pending.

## 15. Calls

| Action | Caller | Recipient | Unrelated account |
|---|---|---|---|

| Control microphone/camera | Own device/session | Own device/session | Denied |
| End call | Participating | Participating | Denied |
| Access recordings | Not available by default | Not available by default | Denied |

Validate permissions at relevant call actions.

Do not assume administrative status authorizes joining private calls.

## 16. Reviews

| Action | Eligible booking participant | Companion reviewed | Unrelated account | Operational staff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read published public review | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |
| Submit verified-booking review | Pending exact reviewer rule | Pending | Denied | No fabricated reviews |

| Report review | Allowed through appropriate route | Allowed | Allowed through appropriate route | Assigned |
| Mark unverified activity as verified | Denied | Denied | Denied | Denied |

Confirm review eligibility, timing, editing, and response rules.

## 17. Blocking and Reporting

Blocking and reporting must not require a subscription or premium plan.

Registered accounts can manage their own block list.

Define block effects on:

- Discovery.
- Profile visibility.
- Messages.
- Calls.
- New requests.
- Existing bookings.

Do not assume blocking cancels a booking, erases a payment obligation,
or authorizes disclosure of private information.

Reports should be visible to:

- The reporter through an appropriately limited status view.
- Assigned operational staff.
- Other parties only when the review process requires disclosure.

Do not expose reporter identity automatically to the reported account.

Provide a suitable reporting/support route for people unable to sign in,
with appropriate abuse controls.

## 18. Moderator and Administrator Boundaries

Operational roles require explicit capabilities.

The prepared provider-intake review increment requires both assigned Moderator/
Administrator membership and `provider_application_review`. It grants read access
only to submitted intake metadata/introductions through scoped backend RPCs. It
does not grant approval, role assignment, audit reading, financial powers, or
access to unrelated private content. No staff capability is assigned at signup.

Possible capabilities include:

- Review public content.
- Review reported private content when necessary.
- Restrict accounts.
- Remove content from display.
- Handle support cases.
- Review booking disputes.
- Reconcile payments.
- Approve financial adjustments.
- Manage roles.
- Review audit records.

Do not grant all capabilities merely because the interface labels
someone a moderator.

Financial duties and sensitive-content review should be separately scoped.

Use audited support actions rather than silent account impersonation.

## 19. Expiry, Suspension, and Revocation

Document consequences before enabling each transition.

| Event | Required decision |
|---|---|
| Companion subscription expires | Media, messaging, calls, booking initiation, and history access |
| Premium membership expires | Excess posts and unused included boosts |
| Publishing expires | Profile visibility, ads, subscribers, and existing bookings |
| Payment fails | Pending access, grace periods, and retries |
| Payment refunded | Entitlement removal and historical records |
| Account suspended | New activity, existing obligations, communication, and payouts |
| Account deleted | Public removal, retained financial records, and associated media |
| Account blocked | Cross-feature interaction consequences |

Unresolved rules must not result in accidental continued paid access.

At the same time, do not erase necessary transaction records or support
access without an approved policy.

## 20. Media Access

Authorize each requested asset according to:

- Owner.
- Associated profile, presentation, or conversation.
- Visibility tier.
- Relevant entitlement.
- Account restrictions.
- Operational capability, if applicable.

Temporary delivery references may remain valid until expiry.
Select duration and revocation behaviour deliberately.

Do not expose protected originals in public previews, HTML source,
metadata, client fixtures, or public storage paths.

## 21. Required Authorization Checks

Before releasing dependent features, verify:

- Anonymous requests cannot retrieve member-only fields.
- Nonsubscribers cannot retrieve subscriber media.
- Companion A’s subscription does not unlock Companion B.
- Premium membership does not unlock companion communication.
- Changing a resource ID does not bypass ownership.
- Draft posts remain private.
- Direct API requests cannot exceed posting allowances.
- Boost balances cannot be modified by clients.
- Message attachments require conversation authorization.
- Realtime channels reject unrelated accounts.
- Call credentials are scoped to authorized participants.
- Operational access is limited to assigned capabilities.
- Expiry and restrictions follow confirmed rules.
- Reporting and support remain available without paid access.

Test the backend boundary, not merely the visibility of buttons.

## 22. Open Decisions

Track confirmations in ../decisions.md.

Pending permissions include:

- Full Looking For post visibility.
- User-profile field visibility.
- One subscription covering both presentations.
- Two-companion booking requirements.
- Historical messaging after expiry.
- Booking-management access after expiry.
- Publishing-expiry consequences.
- Premium-expiry consequences.
- Detailed block effects.
- Review eligibility and responses.
- Operational capabilities and sensitive-data access.
- Grace periods and refund-related entitlement changes.

## 23. Final Rule

Grant the minimum access required by confirmed product rules.

Keep roles, ownership, subscriptions, publishing, and premium benefits
distinct.

Enforce permissions at trusted boundaries and return only authorized data.

## Implemented pilot intake feedback

Requesting application changes requires assigned Moderator/Administrator membership,
`provider_application_review` and a separate `provider_application_feedback` capability.
Self-feedback is denied. Each mutation rechecks actor, scope, submitted state and the
inspected version. Applicants read only their own notes without reviewer identity.
These controls grant no Provider, publishing, subscription or financial privileges.
Pilot approval authority and combined membership are resolved in DEC-023; live
eligibility and publishing remain separate.


## Administrator pilot approval

Approval requires assigned Administrator membership plus both
`provider_application_review` and `provider_application_approval` capabilities.
Moderator membership never grants approval, even with the capability. Require the
exact current submitted snapshot, deny self-review and bind the reviewer to the
verified JWT. Current reviewer authority and applicant basic User membership are
locked during the atomic approval/Provider-role insert. No User role is removed.

Approval records expose only the applicant's own version/time to the applicant;
reviewer identity stays protected. An approved intake record is historical evidence,
not proof of current role assignment after subsequent trusted revocation. The browser
cannot grant roles, assign staff capabilities or modify approval records directly.
No identity/paid/publishing entitlement is granted by this pilot operation.
